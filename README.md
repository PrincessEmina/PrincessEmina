# Hey there, I'm Princess Emina! 👋🏽

I’m a Front-End Developer in training, passionate about creativity, problem-solving, and creating beautiful digital experiences that *just make sense.*

👩🏽‍💻 Currently learning:  
- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript Basics  
- Responsive Web Design  
- Git & GitHub  
- UI/UX Design Principles  

🎯 My goal:  
To become a UI/UX Engineer - someone who not only designs thoughtful interfaces but also brings them to life through clean, intentional code.

✨ What I bring:  
- Strong time & energy management  
- Collaboration, communication, and presentation skills  
- A background in Virtual Assistance and Social Media that helps me think like a user, not just a dev

📚 Upcoming Projects:
